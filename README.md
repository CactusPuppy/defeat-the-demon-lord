Contains the [OSTW](https://github.com/ItsDeltin/Overwatch-Script-To-Workshop) source code used to generate the Workshop code underlying the official **Defeat the Demon Lord** Overwatch 2 arcade mode.

## What is Defeat the Demon Lord?
**Defeat the Demon Lord** is a 4 vs. 1 boss-fight deathmatch inspired by Yeti Hunter, where 4 intrepid heroes work together to overcome 1 buffed Reinhardt. The heroes have naturally quick movement on their side, but the Demon Lord Reinhardt has raw power, map powerups, and augmented abilities to his advantage. In the official game, the heroes must kill Demon Lord Reinhardt 3 times before Reinhardt earns 30 kills on the heroes.
